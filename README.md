# CRX – Give It Up

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You gotta let it go
It won't ever be just right
They'll always put up a fight
What do you wanna know?
It won't ever be enough
They'll always be in your mind
Let it go, baby, let it go
Let it go, baby, let it go
Let it go, baby, let it go
CHORUS
It's never gonna be
What you want it to be
So give it up for me
You're never gonna see
What you wanted to see
So give it up for me
You gotta let it go
Looking for it every night
You don't want what you find
I don't know why you never let up
I don't know when you're gonna get enough
You know it's always gonna be in your mind
Let it go, baby, let it go
Let it go, baby, let it go
Let it go, baby, let it go
Give it up, baby, give it up
Give it up, baby, give it up
Give it up, baby, give it up
CHORUS

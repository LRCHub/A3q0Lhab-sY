I'm confined to you, never give it up
Black swan
Shoot, shoot, shoot
Touch the ground, sinking into blue, my love
Shoot, shoot, shoot

My love will you ever give it up, will you?

Are you ever gonna give it up?
I'll cure it for you
Are you ever gonna give it up?
Give it up
Are you ever gonna give it up?
I'll kill it for you
Are you ever gonna give it up?
Give it up, give it up

I'm designed for you
Never could predict my one true, true, true
Feel the sun lighting up the view
My love for you, ooh

My love will you ever give it up, will you?

Are you ever gonna give it up?
I'll cure it for you
Are you ever gonna give it up?
Give it up
Are you ever gonna give it up?
I'll kill it for you
Are you ever gonna give it up?
Give it up, give it up

Are you ever gonna give it up?
I'll cure it for you
Are you ever gonna give it up?
Give it up
Are you ever gonna give it up?
I'll kill it for you
Are you ever gonna give it up?
Give it up, give it up

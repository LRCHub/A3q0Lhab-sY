It's so nice starting out
I impress you - impress me
Every move we make when we're together
We try to please
It's so much fun, getting started
Checkin' out you, checkin' out me
Making sure we don't overlook
Each other's needs

And then the warning of neglect starts setting in
The dawning of rejection
The next of kin to
Misled affection, loss of direction
Like a loose connection, with no protection

Give it up, or tell where it's at
Give it up, don't treat us like that
Give it up... come together
And give your love to me

It's a wish coming true
Me finding you, finding me
Everything we touch turns to gold
It was so easy
It's a dream coming true
You loving me, loving you
Happiness just seems to unfold
It was so easy

Then the feeling of defeat
Starts setting in
Feeling of deceit, the next of kin
To homemade lies, alibis and
Underfed love, a love that dies

Give it up or tell me where it's at
Give it up, don't treat us like that
Give it up,come together
And give your love to me

Give it up or tell where it's at
Give it up, don't you treat us like that
Give it up, come on together and
Give your love to me

Give it up, then the warning of neglect
Starts setting in
The dawning of rejection
To the next of kin
Misled affection, loss of direction
Like a loose connection with no protection

Then the feeling of defeat starts setting in
Feelings of deceit to the next of kin
Homemade lies, alibis and underfed love
A love that dies
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up

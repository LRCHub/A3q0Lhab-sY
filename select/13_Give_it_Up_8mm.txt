Don't you give it up for me
Don't you open up your soul
And drown in your misery
We all know you don't want help
You want company
Don't you give it up for me

Just how long can you bleed?
Just how long do you need?
Just how long can you bleed?

Don't you give it up for me
Bandage up your palms again
No one can see the blood but you
Won't you get up off your knees?
It's time to run
Don't you give it up for me

Just how long can you bleed?
Just how long do you need?
Just how long can you bleed?
You can't say
Cuz you're so afraid
That all that you have
Is all you deserve
You're so afraid

All that you have
Is all that you deserve
Maybe it is...
Oh maybe it is
Oh maybe it is
Oh baby
It is

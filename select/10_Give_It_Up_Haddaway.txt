All for money
Nothing for time
We want to go
That's our human tight
They sleep on the door mat
They roam the streets

We got to help them
For our future people
We all keep talking 'bout
Brotherly love
The rich stay clean
And the poor gets the glove
I can't sleep at night
When I see their ages
The young and the old

Give it up
If I could only show you love
Baby
Give it up
If I could show you how I feel
Give it up
Give it up

Well, mama was talking
About the ways
They used to live in the early days
Things were simple
And value was right
Everybody got a chance
To live or die
Today you've got it
Tomorrow you don't
But I want more

Give it up
If I could only show you love
Baby
Give it up
If I could show you how I feel
Give it up
Give it up

Love
Give it up
Show your love yeah
Show your lvoe
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it up

Give it up
If I could only show you love
Baby
Give it up
If I could show you how I feel
Give it up
Give it up
